### Scala Book

Lots to unpack here, but learning Scala is a great thing and I'm super excited to have spent the initial time here

Majority of learning tasks are taken from the following

 - https://docs.scala-lang.org/getting-started/sbt-track/getting-started-with-scala-and-sbt-on-the-command-line.html

 - https://docs.scala-lang.org/getting-started/sbt-track/testing-scala-with-sbt-on-the-command-line.html

 - https://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/scala-book/introduction.html

More to come!
